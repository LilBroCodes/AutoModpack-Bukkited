All of the AutoModpack files are kept inside `~/automodpack/` folder.

### Server
Modpack is generated from files inside `~/automodpack/host-modpack/main/` and/or `syncedFiles` (read [config](https://github.com/Skidamek/AutoModpack/wiki/Configuration)) which translates to `~/.minecraft/` (root minecraft instance) folder on client.

Modpack generation means creation of `~/automodpack/host-modpack/automodpack-content.json` which contains metadata of every single file of the modapck. You **should NOT** touch this file manually.

### Client
All of downloaded modpacks are kept inside `~/automodpack/modpacks/`.

All of the selected modpack files are copied to `~/.minecraft/` besides **mods*** (with some exceptions)

Mods are not copied for a reason, it gives AutoModpack full control of what and when load into the loader.

Also AutoModpack tries to delete most of duplicated mods from standard mods folder in favor of AutoModpack's one.

Thanks to that modpack can be seamlessly updated on boot before loading any of modpack mods and just after update it can load whole up-to-date modpack and continue with loading process, otherwise it would require a restart.
